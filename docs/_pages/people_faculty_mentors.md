Faculty mentors are key to safeguarding the intellectual and professional development of trainees in this AIPrN research training program, hence, the success of the program. We currently recruited more than 16 faculty mentors between Prairie View A&M University (6) and Baylor College of Medicine (10), in addition to the three MPDs.
