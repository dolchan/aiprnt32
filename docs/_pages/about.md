The aims of this NIH funded T32 program are to4

   1. Recruit, train, and financially support underrepresented predoctoral students and post-doctoral fellows in AI/ML or nutritional science to the AI-Precision Nutrition research training program as a mechanism to increase the number of effective and diverse scientists integrating AI and Precision Nutrition to address nutrition health disparities; 

   2. Develop and enhance research training program, technical assistance, and mentorship opportunities for such trainees to prepare, build capacity, and advance the field of knowledge and collaborative and integrated research in AI-Precision Nutrition approaches to tackle nutrition health disparities; and

   3. Provide professional development and foster leadership skills in AI-Precision Nutrition for our trainees who are positioned to apply for fellowships, grants, and as a way to facilitate exposure to careers in AI-Precision Nutrition research and transition to research-intensive careers in academia, industry, the NIH, and private foundations. 

These objectives will be met through rigorous didactic training, mentorship, engagement in laboratory rotations for sample research projects, and professional and career development with a team of 12 faculty mentors that span across the chronic diseases mentioned in inclusive and diversity-friendly institutional research environments at PVAMU and the USDA/ARS Children Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine (CNRC). Three predoctoral students and 1 postdoctoral fellow will be recruited each year over the 5- year grant cycle from the highly underrepresented pool of applicants to PVAMU. During the course of their research training, predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows will attend professional development workshops and seminars in grant writing, manuscript development, career development advising with the Career Services, and the NIH mandatory annual cross-site BSSR Data Analytics T32 Program grantee meetings.
