This T32 training program addresses the shortage of diversity in computational and precision nutrition skills for tackling nutritional health disparities. It offers predoctoral and postdoctoral students training in AI, ML, and precision nutrition to study diet quality, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, with mentorship from experts in data science, biostatistics, nutritional sciences, and research methods.  The Trainee Handbook serves as a guide for all trainees to understand and commit to the mission of the program, roles, and evaluation.  This document is subject to annual evaluation and revisions.
