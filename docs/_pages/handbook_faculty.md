The objective of this training program is to address the shortage and lack of diversity of individuals trained in using computational approaches and precision nutrition to address nutritional health disparities.  Faculty mentors are key to safeguarding the intellectual and professional development of trainees in this AIPrN research training program. The Faculty Handbook serves as a guide for all faculty mentors to understand and commit to the mission of the program, roles, and evaluation.  This document is subject to annual evaluation and revisions.
